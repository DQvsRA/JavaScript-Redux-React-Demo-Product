Extend the initial application with the following functionality:

Each form should be implemented on the new page.
The create and update product forms should have the following validation:
- Name is required, length not greater than 200
- Rating is required, integer, not greater than 10
- A product should have from 1 to 5 categories
- If a product has an expiration date it should expire not less than 30 days since now
- If a product rating is greater than 8 it should automatically become “featured” product
